        <p>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I’ve had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. Even though she’s old she’s still kickin’ it and enjoys running around the house at 4am.</p>
        <p>Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting. However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.</p>

        <img src = "images/jingle.jpg" width = 400 alt = "Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His paws are white and they look like mittens."/>

        <p>Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out.</p>
        <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>
